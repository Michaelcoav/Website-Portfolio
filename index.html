          <p>
            My name is Michael Coca-Vargas I am a student at George Mason University studying computer science.
            I began studying computer science because I fell in love with video games at a very young age. 
            The love for video games lead to begin studying computer science in hopes of making my own video game one day. 
            My plan is to become a software developer and make contributions to applications that I can be proud of.
            This is my second attempt at making a Portfolio website, I plan to continue improving it in the future.

        <h4>Account Manager</h4>

        <div class="col-4">

        <div class="col">
          <p>
            The account manager similar to the one made by google that used Python module tkinter, 
            to build the graphical user interface of the program, and SQLite module to store the name of the account,
            the username and password on a relational table. It was my first project outside of school where I got to learn
            about using different python modules.

        <h4>Calculator</h4>

        <div class="col-4">
          <img src="Images/Calculator.png"  class="" alt="">
        </div>
        
        <div class="col">
          <p>
            The calculator was built again using the Python module tkinter, to build the graphical user interface of the program,
            and python was used to create the back end functions. The calculator allows the user to perform addition, subtraction,
            multiplication, and division. It allows you to change the sign of the numbers, add decimals, and delete the most recent 
            number, decimal, or operator from the calculator. It was my second project using tkinter and I felt much more comfortable
            building it.

        <div class="col">
          <p>
            Tic-Tac-Toe was built using the Python module PyGame, to build buttons, draw the shapes, and print the text 
            onto the screen. This was one of my favorite projects because it was very simple and I got to learn about 
            the PyGame module.

        <h4>Data Structures and Algorithms</h4>

        <p>
          I am currently taking a data structures class at George Mason University, where I have learned the basics of 
          data structures along with popular algorithms such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, and 
          dijkstra algorithm. I will be taking an interview prep course for Code Path over the summer to hone my 
          understanding and application of data stuctures and algorithms.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Object-Oriented Programming</h4>
      
        <p>
          I have taken a course in Java on Object-Oriented Programming at George Mason where I learned the basics of 
          Object-Oriented Programming such as classes, fields, methods, and design methods. As well as having to use 
          that knowledge to build my projects and school projects.
        </p>

        <h4>Front-End</h4>

        <p>
          I learned the basics of HTML and CSS in high school for a community college class. I know the main semantics of 
          vanilla HTML such as headers, body, nav, and divs. For css I learned the box model, how to use flex for positioning, 
          and styling techniques such as font, color, etc. I then went on to learn the basics of bootstrap on my own to 
          build this website.
