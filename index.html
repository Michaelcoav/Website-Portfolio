      <p>
        My name is Michael Coca-Vargas I am a student at George Mason University studying computer science.
        The reason I went into computer science was that as a child I have been in love with video games. 
        My love for video games is still alive to this day and has me motivated to gain the skills required to 
        make a video game one day.
        Leading me to pursue a degree in computer science at George Mason University.
        Now I have the confidence to do whatever I want in programming.

        In the summer of 2021, I began my journey with Thinkland where I began my first class teaching a class. 
        In my first class, I taught four students the fundamentals of programming in python. 
        Over the course, I also created my version of fizz buzz that asked for the users' responses. 
        The students created a version of fizz buzz, using what they learned throughout the course.  
        I am currently teaching my second course with four students. I have taught them about functions, modules, classes, and inheritance. 
        I enjoy teaching because it helps me understand the topics more profoundly making me a better programmer.

      <h2>Account Manager</h2>
      <p>
        This was the first project that I had decided to do on my own.
        Where I got to learn a new module in Tkinter, and learn more about graphical user interfaces.
        I also learned about relational SQL in order to be able to store the information in an SQLite3 database using sqllite module.
        It was a great experience because I got to learn new topics on my own.

      <h2>Calculator</h2>
      <p>
        This was my second project that I completed for the course that I am currently teaching. 
        I created it to show the students what they could create using the Tkinter module.
        I felt that the user interface was better on this project, and used what I learned from my previous project.
